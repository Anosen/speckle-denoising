# Contents
This repository contains an implementation of three models:
- Dilated Convolution Autoencoder Denoising Network (Di-Conv-AE-Net)
- Denoising U-Shaped Net (D-U-Net)
- BatchRenormalization U-Net (Br-U-Net)

# Requirements
## For Br-U-Net :
Install the dependency:
```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/ludvb/batchrenorm@master
```

# Troubleshooting
If faced with the error:
```
Could not load library libcudnn_cnn_infer.so.8. Error: libcuda.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
Then run the following to solve:
```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/wsl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
